Click the green `Run>>` button
(ignore any ad)

>Do the changes you made to the code appear in the display?

You can refresh the web page to go back to the original code, but as long as you keep this tab open, you can change and run the code as much as you like

#### Go to 3WSchools: 
Perform a search to see if you can learn how to make one line of the text "_italic_"  
What else can you do?

When you have your code just the way you like it, select it all and copy it  
Or, if you prefer - refresh the tab to get back to the original code, select it all and copy it

#### Go to Glitch: 
Click the `New Project` button and choose "webpage"

Select `index.html`

Select all the code on the page that opens and delete it, pasting in the code you just copied from W3Schools

Click the Show Live button - a new browser tab should open

This is your new web page - you can copy the url and send it to anyone by email, post it to social media, print it on business cards  
You can edit it at any time from the `index.html` page and your changes will automatically appear live, online!
